<h2><strong>about tangelo</strong><br/></h2>
<p>
On November 23, 1892, a fisherman of the United Provinces, India saw a mystical city hanging in air over the mighty 'Yamuna'. He informed of the spotting to Captain Roger Carhousie, who was stationed nearby.
Over the course of the next two days, the town had over a thousand baffled spectators who came along to the river side to witness the miracle. Two days later, 'poof' the town vanished in thin air. The great Sir Donald Peterson, a well known 'ghosthunter' of the time set up his research camp near the site for the next few months, but reached to no conclusion as to what may have happened.
And as it is said, what goes around comes around, The members of the secret Paranormal Society have reasons to believe that the miracle may be seen again between January 18 to 20, 2013.
